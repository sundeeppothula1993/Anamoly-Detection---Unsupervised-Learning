# Anamoly-Detection---Unsupervised-Learning
CIBC - Machine Intelligence Hackathon

Background

Fraud and money-laundering are issues that have been faced by banks and insurance companies for decades.  As companies have moved more on-line it is more difficult for banks and insurance companies to know their customers and the opportunity to commit fraud has increased.  Technology investments in fraud detection and anti-money laundering capabilities to combat the rise in fraudulent activity have grown significantly. Finance industry companies have regulatory anti-money laundering requirements stipulated by the governments of their local countries.  Many fintech companies offer sophisticated fraud detection and anti-money laundering capabilities using artificial intelligence.

Problem Statement
